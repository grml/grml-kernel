The 'perf' tool is dynamically linked with the Python interpreter,
which is itself dynamically linked with OpenSSL, which is not
GPL-compatible.  However, since perf itself does not link with or use
OpenSSL, we believe that this indirect linking does not require
additional permissions beyond the GPL.

The Debian packaging is licensed under the GPL, see above.
