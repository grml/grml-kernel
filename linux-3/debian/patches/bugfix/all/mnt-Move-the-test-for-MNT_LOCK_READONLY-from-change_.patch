Subject: [2/5] mnt: Move the test for MNT_LOCK_READONLY from
 change_mount_flags into do_remount
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/07b645589dcda8b7a5249e096fece2a67556f0f4

There are no races as locked mount flags are guaranteed to never change.

Moving the test into do_remount makes it more visible, and ensures all
filesystem remounts pass the MNT_LOCK_READONLY permission check.  This
second case is not an issue today as filesystem remounts are guarded
by capable(CAP_DAC_ADMIN) and thus will always fail in less privileged
mount namespaces, but it could become an issue in the future.
