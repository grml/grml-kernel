Subject: efivars: Remove check for 50% full on write
Date: Sat, 23 Mar 2013 02:18:42 +0000

On my EFI-booting system (AMI firmware/Asus board), the firmware does
not garbage-collect the variable store until it is rather more than
50% full, and it also updates a variable at every boot.  This check
means that variable writes are guaranteed to fail after the system has
booted more than a few hundred times.

Since pstore integration is now disabled by default in Debian, we will
not normally write that much data before rebooting and giving the
firmware a chance to garbage-collect the variable store.  Therefore,
until the check can be restricted to known-bad systems, it seems less
risky to disable it for now.
