Subject: [PATCH 01/11] x86: Add missing bzImage fields to struct setup_header

commit 8af21e7e71d1ac56d9b66fb787a14fd66af7f5f7 upstream.

commit 37ba7ab5e33c ("x86, boot: make kernel_alignment adjustable; new
bzImage fields") introduced some new fields into the bzImage header
but struct setup_header was not updated accordingly. Add the missing
'pref_address' and 'init_size' fields.
