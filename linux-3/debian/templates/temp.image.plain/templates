Template: linux-image-=V/postinst/depmod-error-initrd-=V
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Abort installation after depmod error?
 The 'depmod' command exited with the exit code ${exit_value}
 (${SIGNAL}${CORE}).
 .
 Since this image uses initrd, the ${modules_base}/=V/modules.dep file
 will not be deleted, even though it may be invalid.
 .
 You should abort the installation and fix the
 errors in depmod, or regenerate the initrd image with a known good
 modules.dep file. If you don't abort the installation, there is
 a danger that the system will fail to boot.

Template: linux-image-=V/prerm/removing-running-kernel-=V
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Abort kernel removal?
 You are running a kernel (version ${running}) and attempting to remove
 the same version.
 .
 This can make the system unbootable as it will remove
 /boot/vmlinuz-${running} and all modules under the directory
 /lib/modules/${running}. This can only be fixed with a copy of the
 kernel image and the corresponding modules.
 .
 It is highly recommended to abort the kernel removal unless you are
 prepared to fix the system after removal.

Template: linux-image-=V/postinst/missing-firmware-=V
Type: note
#flag:translate!:3
_Description: Required firmware files may be missing
 This system is currently running Linux ${runningversion} and you are
 installing Linux ${version}.  In the new version some of the drivers
 used on this system may require additional firmware files:
 .
 ${missing}
 .
 Most firmware files are not included in the system because they do
 not conform to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. You may need to
 reconfigure the package manager to include the contrib and non-free
 sections of the package archive before you can install these
 firmware files.

Template: linux-image-=V/postinst/ignoring-ramdisk
Type: error
_Description: Ramdisk configuration must be updated
 Kernel packages will no longer run a specific ramdisk creator.  The
 ramdisk creator package must install a script in
 /etc/kernel/postinst.d, and you should remove the line beginning
 'ramdisk =' from /etc/kernel-img.conf.
